To get the multiplayer working along with a multiplayer UI I added a "player-info" class to the html and a corresponding css .player-info section. The CSS formats the 3 items I aded in html, a header that displays whos turn it is and two <p> items that that display the players scores. In the javascript file I added an updateUI() function that is called in the check for match function and reset game info function which updates whos turn it is, and a player's score. I also added a switch turn function which is called in the check for match function which switches the player's turn if the other player gets the match wrong.
