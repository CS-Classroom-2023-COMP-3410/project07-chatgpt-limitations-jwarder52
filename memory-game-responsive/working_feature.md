For the memory game responsive, I updated the css file and added media queries in order to change the way the game window and the contents inside it respond to different screen sizes. Along with adding those media queries that had to do with max-width and adjusted things such as teh game container, fruit items, and buttons, I also added changes to .gamecontainer. In this, I added a max-height as well as an auto overflow to allow scrolling when the game contents can't fit within the game window itself. I also added changes to the generatefruitborder() function to dynamically calculate the fruit sizing and spacing.
